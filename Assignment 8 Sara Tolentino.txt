Assignment 8

1) Species: Bos taurus (bosTau9)
2) Gene:ZC3H10
3) Target sequence:AAATGCACAGTTCCGCAATCAGG 
   Genomic location: chr5: 57199983

4)One primer pair 
Left primer sequence:TCCCCATTTTGAATCCTATGAC	
Left primer location:chr5:57200140-57200162
Right primer sequence:GGTTAAAAGTGGCGACAGTACC
Right primer location:chr5:57199899-57199921

5)Knockout of ZC3H10 in Bos taurus would likely result in the following phenotypes:

-Disrupted thermogenesis pathways, potentially impairing the animal's ability to adapt to cold environments.
-Compromised immune function and dysregulation of immunity-related pathways.
-Altered metabolism, particularly affecting glucose and lipid metabolism pathways.
-Decreased adaptability to cold stress, as ZC3H10 plays a significant role in cattle adaptation to cold environments.
